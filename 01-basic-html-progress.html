  <h1>Progress</h2>
  <p> <b>Intention:</b> I want to make random number generator for today </p>
  <p> <b>Update 10:12 AM:</b> I realize that it will need JavaScript to do the processing behind scene. JavaScript will generating the random number and then I will using HTML to display the number generated.
  <p> <b>Update 10:16 AM:</b> To generate the numbe using JavaScript, it will require a extensive use of <i>if</i> function and other different "Math" functions, such as "Math.length" and "Math.random".
  <p> <b>Update 10:20 AM:</b> I realize that to make it work on the HTML side, I will need to learn how to make a input section and way to store informations. I also need to know how to display the data, which I don't know how to do it. 
  <p> <b>Update 10:28 AM:</b> I decide to not do it due to the period ending soon, so I decide to write this instead</p>
